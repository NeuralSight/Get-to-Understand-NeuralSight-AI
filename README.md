## THE PROBLEM

In Africa, healthcare services are overused yet under resourced challenging
healthcare providers with a significant burden to diseases. A patient’s wait
time to receive analyzed lab results is often more than 2 weeks. This has
resulted in late treatment reducing the chances of survival especially with fast
killing diseases such as Tuberculosis, Pneumonia and COVID-19.


## TUBERCULOSIS

It is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide .About 1.8 billion people
are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) the bacteria that causes
TB (close to one quarter of the world's population) – WHO Responsible for
1.4 million deaths in 2019


## MORBIDITY & MORTALITY

Over 2 million children die annually of acute respiratory infections, most often
pneumonia where death can occur after 3 days of illness - World Health
Organization Globally, respiratory, cancerous, and congenital heart diseases
are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the World today
with adverse effects in Africa.


## ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM

An automated tool to help identify diseases has the potential to reduce
hospital workload and optimize patient care during a time when hospitals
are being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.
OUR SOLUTION

An algorithm that uses deep learning & computer vision to identify, label and
highlight over 20 respiratory, heart and breast diseases in Real Time across
various imaging modalities


## CHEST IMAGING

On chest X-rays NeuralSightTM is capable of Identifying, Labeling and
Highlighting over 10 respiratory pathologies which include: Aortic
Enlargement, Infiltration, effusion, etc.

MAMMOGRAPHY IMAGING

On breast images NeuralSightTM is capable of identifying malignant which
causes breast cancer as well as Benign, a condition that causes growth or other
changes in breast tissue.
