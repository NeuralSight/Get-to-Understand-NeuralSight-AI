# Getting Started
## Introduction
Radiologists are faced with a high volume of medical images and a shortage of radiologists. Across the world, there's also an exponential increase in the number of patients who need radiology services. Our solution is deep learning and computer vision based technology that screens medical images in real time, helping Radiologists save time, reduce radiation exposure for patients, and improve patient experience.

We are proposing web Software as a service (SAAS) and mobile application( to be developed in the future) that will be  accessible to medical practitioners such as radiologists, radiographers, hospitals and diagnostic centres. This involves developing an application based on the DICOM standard which allows the upload of medical images such as digital radiography, ultrasonography,  secondary pictures and scanned images, digital angiography etc.,in various formats (JPEG,PNG ) be it monochromatic, coloured,  static images, uncompressed and compressed images. 

## The Solution
Our AI algorithm NeuralSightâ„¢ is capable of identifying 15 respiratory and heart diseases which include: Pneumonia, COVID-19, Aortic enlargement, Atelectasis, Calcification, Cardiomegaly,Consolidation, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), Infiltration, Lung Opacity, Nodule/Mass, Pleural effusion, Pleural thickening, Pneumothorax, Pulmonary fibrosis  in Real Time.
