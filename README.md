# Getting Started
## Introduction
Radiologists are faced with a high volume of medical images and a shortage of radiologists. Across the world, there's also an exponential increase in the number of patients who need radiology services. Our solution is deep learning and computer vision based technology that screens medical images in real time, helping Radiologists save time, reduce radiation exposure for patients, and improve patient experience.

We are proposing web Software as a service (SAAS) and mobile application( to be developed in the future) that will be  accessible to medical practitioners such as radiologists, radiographers, hospitals and diagnostic centres. This involves developing an application based on the DICOM standard which allows the upload of medical images such as digital radiography, ultrasonography,  secondary pictures and scanned images, digital angiography etc.,in various formats (JPEG,PNG ) be it monochromatic, coloured,  static images, uncompressed and compressed images. 

## The Solution
Our AI algorithm NeuralSightâ„¢ is capable of identifying 15 respiratory and heart diseases which include: Pneumonia, COVID-19, Aortic enlargement, Atelectasis, Calcification, Cardiomegaly,Consolidation, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), Infiltration, Lung Opacity, Nodule/Mass, Pleural effusion, Pleural thickening, Pneumothorax, Pulmonary fibrosis  in Real Time.

### Integration
AI solutions in pathology are usually standalone tools, each having its  own interface for data input, output and execution. To ensure flawless usability in diagnostic routine, these tools must be integrated into the laboratory IT infrastructure and made interoperable with software developed by other manufaturers.

To use AI solutions in pathology you would require three pieces of software. 
* Image Archive
* Lab Information System
* Pathology Workstation


### Integration of artificial intelligence
Integration of AI solutions into the laboratory IT infrastructure can be done as either standalone tools or workstation extensions. One huge advantage of standalone tools is their flexibility. This means they can be tailored to the specific needs of the analysis methods in terms of user interaction, parameterization and visualization. Workstation extensions, on the other hand, have the major advantage of workflow efficiency. They can be used without having to leave familiar workstation environments and without having to learn new tools. They also have a low development cost and are very interoperable software from other manufacturers. 


### Cooperation is crucial
It is important for Neural Labs Africa to involve pathologists from an early stage of development. To obtain sufficient amounts of training and test data, partnerships must be established with pathologists and incentives be provided for them to provide image data and required annotations. Partnerships with multiple laboratories is essential in order to obtain a sample of interlaboratory variability.


### Other challenges
There are further challenges in producing AI solutions that are beyond the scope of this report. This concerns the many algorithmic challenges associated with AI development, which have already been addressed in numerous publications. Other concerns include issues of usability and user experience.
